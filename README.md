Stud'Up is a desktop application, written in C#, by a team of 6 members (on which I was the lead) in a School Project.
It is based on a 4-tier architecture : Presentation Layer, Business Layer, Data Access Layer and Database.

Its main aim is to help students managing their daily or weekly schedule, by adding, removing, editing tasks and activities, with reminders.
